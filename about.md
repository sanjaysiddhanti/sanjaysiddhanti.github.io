## Hi, I'm Sanjay

I'm a Senior Software Engineer focused on data engineering, web development, bioinformatics, and dev ops.

Previously I was a software engineer at Karius and Counsyl, and a software engineering intern at Flatiron Health and Figure Eight.

I have a B.S. in Computer Science and M.S. in Biomedical Informatics from Stanford University. While at Stanford, I did research with Gill Bejerano and Andrew Ng.

Outside of work, I enjoy sports, cooking, meditation, and reading.
