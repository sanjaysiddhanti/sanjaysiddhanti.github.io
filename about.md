## Hi, I'm Sanjay

I'm an Engineering Manager at Alpha Health. I love building software that helps patients have a better experience with healthcare. My interests include data engineering, web development, bioinformatics, and dev ops.

Previously I built software for Karius (infectious disease diagnostics using genomic sequencing), Counsyl (genetic screening focused on women's health), and Flatiron Health (improving cancer care with structured data).

I have a B.S. in Computer Science and M.S. in Biomedical Informatics from Stanford University. While at Stanford, I did research with Andrew Ng and Gill Bejerano.

Outside of work, I enjoy sports, cooking, meditation, and reading.
